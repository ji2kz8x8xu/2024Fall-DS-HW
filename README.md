## How to Build and Run

1. **Enter** the exercise folder (e.g., `cd DS1ex02`).
2. **Build**: `g++ DS1ex02.cpp -o DS1ex02`.
3. **Execute**: `./DS1ex02` (on Windows, `DS1ex02.exe`).
4. **Follow** on-screen instructions to provide filenames or other parameters.

## Exercises at a Glance

- **DS1ex02**: Student data management (copy, filter, merge).
- **DS1ex03**: Maze solver with custom stack, path marking.
- **DS1ex04**: Order queue simulation (FIFO & SQF) with timeout reports.
- **DS1ex05**: Pokémon BST by HP, with traversal and search features.
